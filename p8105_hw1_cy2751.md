## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins",package = "palmerpenguins")
```

In the `penguins` dataset, we have 8 variables in total (8 columns).  
They are:`species`,`island`,`billing length` in mm,`bill depth` in
mm,`flipper length` in mm, `body mass` in g, `sex` and `year`.  
In variable `species`, we have three categories: `Adelie`,`Chinstrap`
and `Gentoo`.  
For variable `island`, we also have three categories:`Biscoe`,`Dream`
and `Torgersen`.  
This dataset consists of information from 344 samples (344 rows).  
The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

``` r
(flipper_bill_plot = 
  ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     colour = species))+
  geom_point())
```

## Problem 2

``` r
(random_df = tibble(
  ran_numeric = rnorm(10),
  ran_logical = ran_numeric >0,
  ran_chara = c("ab","cd","ef","gh","ij","kl","mn","op","qr","st"),
  ran_factor = factor(c("low","med","high","low","med",
                        "high","med","high","med","high"))
))
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    ran_numeric ran_logical ran_chara ran_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1      -0.487 FALSE       ab        low       
    ##  2      -1.32  FALSE       cd        med       
    ##  3       0.163 TRUE        ef        high      
    ##  4       0.358 TRUE        gh        low       
    ##  5       2.40  TRUE        ij        med       
    ##  6       0.241 TRUE        kl        high      
    ##  7       0.331 TRUE        mn        med       
    ##  8       1.72  TRUE        op        high      
    ##  9      -0.440 FALSE       qr        med       
    ## 10       0.703 TRUE        st        high

``` r
(mean_for_numeric = mean(pull(random_df,ran_numeric)))
```

    ## [1] 0.3674451

``` r
(mean_for_logical = mean(pull(random_df,ran_logical)))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
(mean_for_chara = mean(pull(random_df,ran_chara)))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(random_df, ran_chara)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
(mean_for_factor = mean(pull(random_df,ran_factor)))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(random_df, ran_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean function works for numerical variable and logical vector; but
not working for character vector and factor vector.  

``` r
(ran_log_numeric = as.numeric(pull(random_df,ran_logical)))
(ran_chara_numeric = as.numeric(pull(random_df,ran_chara)))
(ran_factor_numeric = as.numeric(pull(random_df,ran_factor)))
```

When we apply `as.numeric` to logical, character and factor variables,
we can see:  
logical variable becomes 0 and 1(0 representing FALSE and 1 representing
TRUE);  
character variable coerced to be NA;  
and factor variable becomes 1,2 and 3, each stands for one level.  
The reason behind this might be:  
for logical variable, the answer can only be `TRUE` or `FALSE`, we can
transfer them to be 0 and 1 representing the chance of issue happened.
This also explains why we can take mean of logical variable, it is just
showing the proportion of True value.  
for character variable, it can be anything: a sentence, a word or even a
paragraph, it cannot be directly converted into numerical variable
unless it is just number with quotation mark. Accordingly, it explains
why we cannot take mean of character variable.  
for factor variable, we can use `as.numeric` to transfer factor variable
to numerical variable, because it is actually `1` stands for `level1`,
`2` stands for `level2` … But we cannot take mean of it. Because for
here, numerical values are not simply a number, it has its internal
meanings, we are just using a simply way to represent factor variable.
This explains what happened when we take the mean value.
